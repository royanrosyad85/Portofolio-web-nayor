## 🚀 Deployment

### **Cloudflare Pages (Production)**

The production site is `royanrosyad.pages.dev`. The existing Workers Builds Git
integration builds `main` and uploads `dist` to the Pages project `royanrosyad`.

Use these production build settings:

- Build command: `npm ci --include=dev && npm run build`
- Deploy command: `npx --yes wrangler@4.149.0 pages deploy dist --project-name royanrosyad --branch main`
- Root directory: `/`
- Build variables: `SKIP_DEPENDENCY_INSTALL=1` and `NODE_VERSION=22.23.2`
- Build API token: account permission **Cloudflare Pages → Edit** for the hosting account.

Preview builds use the same npm build command and variables, with deploy command
`npx --yes wrangler@4.149.0 pages deploy dist --project-name royanrosyad --branch preview-${WORKERS_CI_BRANCH:?}`.
The `preview-` prefix keeps preview uploads separate from production `main`.

Automatic dependency installation must stay disabled: the repository also contains
Bun and pnpm lockfiles, which can make Cloudflare select a different installer.
Use npm and update `package-lock.json` whenever dependencies change. Before merging
to `main`, run `npm ci --include=dev`, `npm run lint`, and `npm run build`.

Changing build settings does not deploy files by itself. Retry the build after a
settings change, then confirm its deploy step succeeds and the Pages production
deployment points to the intended commit.

### **Netlify (Alternative)**
1. Connect repository to Netlify
2. Configure build settings:
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `dist`
3. Deploy automatically on git push

### **Other Platforms**
- **Vercel**: Zero-config deployment for React apps
- **GitHub Pages**: Static site hosting
- **Custom Domain**: Configurable with DNS settings
